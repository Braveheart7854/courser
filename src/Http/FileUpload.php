     * appropriate method (move_uploaded_file(), rename(), or a stream
     * operation) to perform the operation.
     *
     * $targetPath may be an absolute path, or a relative path. If it is a
     * relative path, resolution should be the same as used by PHP's rename()
     * function.

     * an exception.
     *
     * When used in an SAPI environment where $_FILES is populated, when writing
     * files via moveTo(), is_uploaded_file() and move_uploaded_file() SHOULD be
     * used to ensure permissions and upload status are verified correctly.

     * cannot guarantee writing to stream destinations.
